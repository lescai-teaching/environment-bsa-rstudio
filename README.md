This is a no-content repository, with the sole purpose of facilitating the launch of an RStudio Server provisioned through a Docker image and run using [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/introduction).

In order to run this, please make sure:

1. You have a GitHub account: if not, create one [here](https://github.com/signup)
2. Once you have a GitHub account, sign up for GitPod using your GitHub user [here](https://gitpod.io/login/) choosing "continue with GitHub".

Now you're all set and can use the following button to launch the service.

The user and password for RStudio on gitpod is:
username = gitpod
password = rstudio
